CS 330 Final Project – 3D Scene
This project showcases my work in computational graphics and visualization. Using OpenGL, I designed and developed a 3D scene that integrates textured objects, lighting, and interactive camera navigation. The project highlights my ability to create a fully realized 3D environment and to follow a structured design and development process.
When approaching the design, I focused on breaking the project into smaller, manageable components. I began with basic geometry, added textures and lighting, and then refined camera controls to create an interactive experience. Each milestone built upon the last, and through iteration I was able to improve both the functionality and the visual quality of the scene.
This project helped me strengthen my skills in modular design, debugging, and shader programming, while also teaching me the importance of systematic planning over trial and error. The design and development tactics I practiced—such as prototyping, incremental testing, and modular organization—are strategies I can apply to future projects in software engineering, data visualization, and beyond.
Overall, this experience not only gave me technical skills in graphics programming but also reinforced the value of iteration, problem-solving, and adaptability—skills that will serve me well in my educational and professional path.
